# BioData
Sample REST client and server for processing genomic data.

## Installation
You will need to have node and npm installed in order to run this code (https://nodejs.org)

From the root directory of the project, run:
```
npm install
```

All commands specified below are also to be run from the root directory of the project.

## Client
A simple command-line Node.js script that fetches requested genomic sequences from the Ensembl API. Run with:
```
/path/to/node client.js <species> <region>
```

e.g.
```
/usr/local/bin/node client.js human X:1000000..1000100:1
```

## Server
A REST server with two endpoints:
- **GET /sequence/region/:species/:region** (a proxy for the Ensembl endpoint with the same path)
- **POST /sequence/statistics** (calculates nucleotide percentages)

Run:
```
/usr/local/bin/node server.js
```

A sequence can be fetched using the same conventions as Ensembl, e.g.
```
http://localhost:5678/sequence/region/human/X:1000000..1000100:1
```

Statistics can be generated by posting a JSON object containing a seq parameter, e.g.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"seq":"CAGCTAC"}' http://localhost:5678/sequence/statistics
```

## Tests
To run tests:
```
npm test
```
