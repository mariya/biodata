# BioData
Sample REST client and server for processing genomic data.

## Installation
You will need to have node and npm installed in order to run this code (https://nodejs.org)

From the root directory of the project, run:
```
npm install
```

All commands below are also to be run from the root directory of the project. Note that on some installations you will need to use the "nodejs" binary instead of "node".

## Client
A simple command-line Node.js script that fetches requested genomic sequences from the Ensembl API. Run with:
```
/path/to/node client.js <species> <region>
```

e.g.
```
node client.js human X:1000000..1000100:1
```

## Server
A REST server with two endpoints:
- **GET /sequence/region/:species/:region** (a proxy for the Ensembl endpoint with the same path)
- **POST /sequence/statistics** (calculates nucleotide percentages)

Run:
```
node server
```

A sequence can be fetched using the same conventions as Ensembl, e.g.
```
http://localhost:5678/sequence/region/human/X:1000000..1000100:1
```

Statistics can be generated by posting a JSON object containing a seq parameter, e.g.
```
curl -H "Content-Type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"seq":"CAGCTAC"}' http://localhost:5678/sequence/statistics
```

## Tests
To run tests:
```
npm test
```
